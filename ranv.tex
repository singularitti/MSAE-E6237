\subsubsection{\texttt{RANV} subroutine}
\label{sssec:ranv}

This subroutine is dedicated for setting up Maxwell distributed random velocities
at temperature $T$. A scaling factor \texttt{vfac} is calculated based on
\begin{equation}
    k_B T = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 } m v^2,
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the atomic mass, and $v$ is \texttt{vfac}.
In the latter part of this subroutine, the temperature is checked (every \texttt{ntcheck} time steps),
and the velocities of atoms are rescaled by $\overline{E} = \frac{ 3 }{ 2 } k_B T$, where $T$ is current
temperature.
