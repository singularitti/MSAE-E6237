\subsubsection{\texttt{FORC} subroutine}
\label{sssec:forc}

Subroutine \texttt{FORCLJ} is used for analytical computation, and this one is
used as numerical formulation.
We have talked about \texttt{RDPP} subroutine before, stating that it reads
$n (n+1)$ columns of potentials and forces, denoted as \texttt{vpp} and
\texttt{fpp}, respectively.
The potentials interpolated by quadratic functions, the forces are also
calculated similar process.
