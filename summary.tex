\section{Summary}

In this report, I summarized some common integration methods used in nowadays
molecular dynamics studies, reviewed literature on VCSMD and \textit{ab initio} MD,
and applied the VCSMD code developed by Wentzcovitch on a simple crystal structure.
Gradually do I get familiar with what the dynamics are, especially how the frequencies are controlled. I believe this project paves the way for my further study in molecular dynamics.
